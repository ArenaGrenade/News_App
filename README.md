A simple news app

# Testing saved articles feature
** Handle with care **

1) `/display_articles` to view available links stored in dB

2) `/newstest` Enter the link to add to database (HANDLE WITH CARE. This is autmatically inserted into db when pulling from API)

3) `/favorite_articles` Enter the ID of a news article (you can get this from `/display_articles`) to save it
